## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm 9.x or higher
- **For AI Features (Optional)**:
  - OpenAI API key for AI completions and chat
  - Qdrant vector database for semantic search
  - 8GB+ RAM recommended for optimal AI performance

### Quick Start
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AP3X-DEV/morpheus-ide.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd morpheus-ide
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables (optional, for AI features):
   ```bash
   # Create .env file
   REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   REACT_APP_QDRANT_URL=http://localhost:6333
   ```

4. Start Qdrant vector database (optional, for AI features):
   ```bash
   docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The IDE will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### AI Features Setup

#### Full AI Setup (Recommended)
For the complete AI experience with semantic search and intelligent completions:

1. **Get OpenAI API Key**: Sign up at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) and create an API key
2. **Start Qdrant**: Run the vector database using Docker (see step 4 above)
3. **Configure Environment**: Set your API keys in the `.env` file
4. **Load Project**: Import or create a project to enable AI indexing

#### Demo Mode
The IDE works without API keys using mock AI services. You can explore the interface and basic functionality, though AI features will be simulated.
